Warning messages:
1: There were 27 divergent transitions after warmup. See
https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup
to find out why this is a problem and how to eliminate them. 
2: There were 7597 transitions after warmup that exceeded the maximum treedepth. Increase max_treedepth above 15. See
https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#maximum-treedepth-exceeded 
3: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems
 
4: The largest R-hat is 2.35, indicating chains have not mixed.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#r-hat 
5: Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior means and medians may be unreliable.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#bulk-ess 
6: Tail Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior variances and tail quantiles may be unreliable.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#tail-ess 
Warning messages:
1: Parts of the model have not converged (some Rhats are > 1.05). Be careful when analysing the results! We recommend running more iterations and/or setting stronger priors. 
2: There were 27 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta above 0.99 may help. See http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup 
3: Parts of the model have not converged (some Rhats are > 1.05). Be careful when analysing the results! We recommend running more iterations and/or setting stronger priors. 
4: There were 27 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta above 0.99 may help. See http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup 
5: In min(neff) : no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf
